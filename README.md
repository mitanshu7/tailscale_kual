# Tailscale for Kindle (KUAL)
This (very very) simple repo allows you to connect your kindle remotely from anywhere using Tailscale VPN.


## Prerequisites:

1. Jailbroken Kindle. ([see](https://kindlemodding.gitbook.io/kindlemodding))
2. [KUAL](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/KUAL) installed. ([see](https://kindlemodding.gitbook.io/kindlemodding/post-jailbreak/installing-kual-mrpi))
3. [USBNetworking](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Hacks_Information#USB_networking_UN) hack installed and [enabled](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/USBNetwork). 
4. Set up ssh keys for ease of use.


## Usage:

1. Download the repository.
2. Get the latest tailscale binaries for the `arm` architecture from [here](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#static). Or see releases page for a version that worked for me.
3. Place the `tailscale` and `tailscaled` binaries in the `tailscale/bin` folder of this (local) repository.
4. Place the tailscale folder into the `extensions` folder on your kindle.
5. In the KUAL menu, start `tailscaled` first then start `tailscale`.
6. You can find the url to login in the `extensions/tailscale` folder in `tailscale_start_log.txt` file, if this is a first time setup.
7. Copy the login url to a modern web browser and login using your preferred SSO.
8. After connecting the device should add the kindle to your `Machines` page on tailscale admin console. ([this](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines)).
9. Now you can see the (static) IP address assigned by Tailscale for your machine. You can use this ip to connect to kindle.
10. Note: Make sure the kindle screen is on, else the kindle sleeps the wifi.
